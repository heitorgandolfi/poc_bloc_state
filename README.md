# PoC State Management with Bloc in Flutter

This repository was created as part of a Proof of Concept (PoC) to explore and test the Bloc (Business Logic Component) state management pattern in Flutter app development. Bloc is an effective methodology for maintaining application state in a clear, scalable, and reactive manner, and this PoC serves as a playground to showcase its usage and potential.
